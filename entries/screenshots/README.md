Screenshots are taken from the game websites themselves or from the games themselves,
in that case no URL will be given. They are reduced in resolution to 128 pixel height and stored as jpg with
compression factor 85, to save storage and because they are considered not very important for us. This file contains
information about which game (use canonical name, i.e. the file name) has which screenshots with which resolutions.
When the website is updated, the screenshots can be included at the right positions. The use of these screenshots is
considered fair use and no special labeling is needed.
